# K-Mean-clustering

Elbow Method: Plotted inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) to pick K.
Silhouette Score: Measures how well each point fits into its cluster (closer to 1 = better).
I showed clear plots for both elbow and final clusters.I replaced make_blobs() with your actual Mall Customers dataset if you have it.
